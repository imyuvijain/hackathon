#What is it/What does it do?
Our website helps you remind and also helps you to organize your tasks and your appointments. Another feature is that it gives you a personal account 
so that you can track your details. We also have some remedies for common problems/diseases that can be solved. These remedies are efficient, easy to 
do and also less time-consuming...
#How can we run it?
1. If you are new to the website you can either click on "Start Enrollment" or you could click on the "Sign Up" button at the top-right corner of the page.
2. You will then come to a page where you either have to sign up or login
3. Then after that you can see a button at the top that says "Schedule", when you click on that you will be redirected to a schedule.
4. You will see 3 button, one is for timetable, the other for feedback and the last but not the least is for the remedies. 
5. In feedback you can add feedback, in timetable you can add tasks, reminders etc and in remedies you can see a few home remedies that can be used. 

#How does the project meet the 'Stop, Drop and Vote' theme'?
The organization is an important aspect of each and every person's life... It helps you focus on your daily tasks. Generally, most people tend to forget 
important tasks. To "Stop" this from happening we have come up with a website that organizes and also reminds you of your everyday tasks and 
appointments. Another aspect is health. Nowadays, many people have become so busy that they are not able to notice the "Drop" in their health. 
To help you with this we provide remedies that are easy, efficient, and less time-consuming. Remedies for problems like Cough, Pneumonia, Obesity, 
etc are mentioned. You can also add appointments and reminders in the timetable that can help keep your life organized and healthy......

#What problem does your project solve? "It helps introduce young people to more video games by doing..."
The problem/ issue/ challenge the project addresses is how people are tending to forget tasks and how they forget to focus on their
health as their day gets busier by the minute... This can affect and might also lead to some common and short term problems like
Lack of Sleep, Hurting of Eyes, etc..... Our website is like a solution for these two main problems, health, and organizing...

#Could you improve your project somehow if you had more time? What would you do?
Yes, if we had more time on hand we would be able to add more features and make the website easier to use... We were thinking about adding a 
progress bar that helps you keep track of how you have been doing... Another feature we were thinking about adding was making a code that would 
remind the user of their appointments and also remind them if their health status is dropping or increasing... And we would add more remedies as 
that would be more helpful. If we had more time, we would also connect the website to a database. Right now, the data gets reset every time the server restarts. We were also not able to make the schedule part different for every person and it gets reset every time you refresh the page.
